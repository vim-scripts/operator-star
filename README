INTRODUCTION

This plugin provides the operator versions
of *, g*, #, g#. star is * (:help star).

No default keymappings, so please map to
your favorite keymappings like the followings:

    nmap <Leader>*  <Plug>(operator-*)
    nmap <Leader>g* <Plug>(operator-g*)
    nmap <Leader>#  <Plug>(operator-#)
    nmap <Leader>g# <Plug>(operator-g#)


This plugin has two dependency plugins.

- visualstar (vimscript#2944)
- operator-user (vimscript#2692)


USAGE EXAMPLE

- <Leader>*iw or viw<Leader>* is the same as *. it's no use in this case :(
- <Leader>*<Leader>* to search the same line as the cursor line.
- <Leader>*iW to search the WORD under the cursor.
- or you can even combine with another useful text-object plugins like these:

* is almost the same as /<C-r>=expand('<cword>')<CR> .
/ is very handy moving command.
* is also handy shortcut for / command.
operator-star strongly helps you to move around quickly in the source code, text, etc.
